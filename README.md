# AREA OF TRIANGLE USING THE FORMULA A = (b * h) / 2

DESCRIPTION:

A program that calculates the area of a triangle using the formula A = (b * h) / 2. This program prompt the user to enter the base and height of the triangle and then display the calculated area.

HOW IT WORKS:

1. We first import the dart:io library to use the stdin and stdout objects for user input and program output, respectively.

2. We prompt the user to enter the base of the triangle and store it as a double value in the base variable. We use the readLineSync() method to read the user's input from the command line and the double.parse() method to convert the user's input from a string to a double.

3. We do the same for the height of the triangle, storing the user's input as a double value in the height variable.

4. We calculate the area of the triangle using the formula A = (b * h) / 2 and store it as a double value in the area variable.

5. We use string interpolation to output the calculated area to the console in a user-friendly message.
